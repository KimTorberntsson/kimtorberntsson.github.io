This is my personal homepage, which contains my blog, some photos and my resume. It is built using Jekyll and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

The Jekyll source is what can be seen in this repository. Once built the static generated site will be located in the folder _site. For more information about how this works, the build process and why this is cool visit [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
