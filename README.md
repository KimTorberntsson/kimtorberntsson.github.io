This is my personal blog. It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

The Jekyll source code is what can be seen in this repository. Once built the static generated site will be located in the folder _site. For more information about how this works, the build process and why this is cool visit Jekyll's [homepage](http://jekyllrb.com).

You are free to use and copy all code without any permission. If you have use of anything at all I would be very happy if you told me. Also if anyone has any questions regarding the design or anything regarding the site you are free to contact me in some form.
