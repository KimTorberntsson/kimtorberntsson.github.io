Last weekend my mom's 50th birthday was celebrated by friends and family in Linköping. I have now (after a week of exams) had time to go through the photos. I want to point out that Mikaela was the main photographer here. Well, you might say, who took the photo of you and Mikaela then? That was my cousin Lara, who also helped out as a waitress. Thanks to Lara for that.

I'd also like to thank mom for a really nice evening with lots of laughter. See you soon.
