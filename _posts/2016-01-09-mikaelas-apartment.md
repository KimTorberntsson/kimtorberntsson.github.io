Here's a post with a few pictures of [Mikaela's](https://www.facebook.com/mikaela.blom?fref=ts) new apartment, where she'll live while I'm in California. The building is completely new and everything is really nice and fresh. I have to say that Mikaela has done a great job with the interior design. Yesterday we took a walk towards the city and passed by the swan (more like duck) pond. Just so you know that the last picture is not of the bathroom or anything like that.
