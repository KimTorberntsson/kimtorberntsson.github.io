When I still was in Sweden about a week ago me and Mikaela saw the second season of [Fargo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/?ref_=nv_sr_1) by the [Coen Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers). The series, based on the same events as depicted in the 1996 [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/?ref_=nv_sr_2) (also by the Coen brothers) is one of the best tv-series I have ever seen. I am fascinated by the cold and lonely towns up in Minnesota and I absolutely love the strange accents and the Swedish-inspired names of the citizens. It's a unique setting that you don't often see in mainstream movies. What makes it so great is how quite ordinary people make really bad choices in extremely dangerous situations that they don't fully understand. 

Then all of a sudden at the end credits of some episode, I immediately recognize the soft voice of [Justin Vernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Vernon) (most famous for [Bon Iver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver)) singing a beautiful song that I don't recognize. I google for a bit since I really want to listen to the song in it's entirety and find out that the song is from an album by [The Chaiftains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chieftains), an Irish folk band I've never heard of. It turns out that their latest album called [Voice of Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_Ages) feature a couple of really amazing musicians, like [The Civil Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Civil_Wars), [The Decemberists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decemberists) and [Lisa Hannigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Hannigan) among many others. 

I find Justin's song and really like it, but the best song of the album is really another song; a cover of [Bob Dylan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) [When The Ship Comes In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Ship_Comes_In) performed by the Decemberists (and the Chieftains). It's funny when you start somewhere and then all of a sudden end up in some other seemingly completely unrelated place. Makes me think of my situation right now actually, but let's not get into that right now.

Anyway, below is a Youtube video with the song. I'm sure you'll all love it and like most other Bob Dylan songs the [lyrics](http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/when-ship-comes) are amazing as well.
