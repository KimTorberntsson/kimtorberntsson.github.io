It's been a while now. Like always when I start a project, I'm super exited and have lots of ideas at the start. Then after a while I find some other thing that I put my time into.

But now I'm back with an update. This weekend I bought a new camera and borrowed some vintage lenses from [Martin Hultgren](http://www.martinhultgren.se), so I wanted to share some photos I (and William) took this weekend. Mikaela celebrated her 27:th birthday at our new place in [Vallastaden](https://www.vallastaden2017.se) (oops that link was already a bit dated) and we had our families over.

I took the opportunity to take some portrait photos and now I'm probably gonna have to buy some old lenses myself. I really like some of these photos!
