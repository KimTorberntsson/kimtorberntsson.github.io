Now I have received two out of three vintage lenses I ordered from Japan and they are awesome! I played around with the Canon FD 50mm 1:1.4 and took some photos just around the apartment. You can get some pretty spectacular pictures with such a large aperture and I wanted to share just a couple of photos.

The final lens is already an interesting story, since [postnord](https://tyda.se/search/klumpeduns) wants me to pay 14800kr in customs duty for a lens that cost me around 500kr (just a mistake of course, but a bit funny). 

When it arrives I'll have a great set of prime lenses to play around with.
