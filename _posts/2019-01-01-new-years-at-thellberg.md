This year I spent new years with Mikaela, Frida and our host Malin at Thellbergâ„¢, located just outside of [Rimforsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimforsa). We had an great evening . I acted camera guy and food assistant for our six?! course menu, which was probably the best new years menu I've ever had.

Oh and me and Mikaela are having a child in April this year, as you might be able to tell from the photos. So expect more of that here in the future. We're so happy and exited <3
