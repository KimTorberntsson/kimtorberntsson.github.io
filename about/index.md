Welcome to my personal blog. If you don't already know (then how did you get here?) my name is Kim Torberntsson. I'm studying Engineering Physics at Uppsala University and I used to live in Uppsala with my lovely fianc√©e [Mikaela Blom](https://www.facebook.com/mikaela.blom?fref=ts), but during half a year I'm doing my master thesis project at Stanford in California. The work is really super interesting and it's so cool to get the chance to work at Stanford, right in Silicon Valley. Obviously it's sad to leave you behind Mikaela, but we'll live together soon again. That's a promise. 

During the autumn of 2014 I took a course in web design and learned just enough to build a simple web site. About a year later the 2.0 version of the site was finished, now built using Jekyll and featuring a new sub-page with my personal blog. Later on I realized that the blog should be in the center of everything, so I decided to get rid of the page with my resume (you can see it better on [LinkedIn](http://se.linkedin.com/in/kimtorberntsson)). I also removed a page containing a couple of photos. Instead I added a page that collects all the photos from the blog entries, which I think makes much more sense.

For me, this is mostly a way of dipping my feet into web design and to have a medium for whenever I feel like writing a post. I really want everything to be as open as possible, so therefore the source code for this site is available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/KimTorberntsson/kimtorberntsson.github.io). You can copy and use it as you like, and the same holds for all of the photos. I would be extremely happy if someone could learn from my page and get inspired, it's really not as difficult as you might think to set up a blog like this using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 

Lastly, I just wanna thank you for stopping by. See you around.
