Welcome to my personal blog. If you don't already know (then how did you get here?) my name is Kim Torberntsson. I've been working at Sectra in Link√∂ping for the last couple of years, where I'm building software for radiologists all over the world.

As with all things, the motivation for posting things and keeping the blog updated goes up and then down. From the start, this was mostly about learning some new technologies and for showing my family and closest friends what I was doing while studying at Stanford. Since returning home I havn't really had the motivation for posting new stuff. But who know's what'll happen in the future, I'll have this site up for a while I think. See you around <3

Kim
