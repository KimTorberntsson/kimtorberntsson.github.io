Welcome to my personal little location on the web. If you don't already know my name is Kim Torberntsson. I live in Uppsala with my lovely fianc√©e Mikaela Blom and am currently studying Engineering Physics at Uppsala University. During the autumn of 2014 I took a course in web design and learned just enough to build a simple web site. About a year later the 2.0 version of the site was finished, now built using Jekyll and featuring a new sub-page with my personal blog.

For me, this is mostly a way of dipping my feet into web design. Most content will definitely be located in the blog area, but I wanted to have a few additional pages as well. Photographer Scott Kelby once said that you should have your 24 best photos on your personal site, so I added a page with them. Though to be honest I'm not really sure that they are my very best ones. Also, Mikaela took some of them, so I can't really take credit for them all anyway. You will find lots of other photos in the form of backgrounds or as parts of blog entries if you keep your eyes open (and avoid using a phone if you really want to look at the backgrounds in their entirety). There is also a page with my resume and of course this welcome page. 

The source code for this site is available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/KimTorberntsson/kimtorberntsson.github.io). You can copy and use it as you like. And thanks for stopping by.
