Hello
======

Welcome to my personal homepage. If you don't already know (I guess you do) my name is Kim Torberntsson. I live in Uppsala with my lovely fianc√©e Mikaela Blom and am currently studying Teknisk Fysik (Applied Physics) to eventually become an engineer. During the autumn of 2014 I took a course in web design and learned just enough to understand that I had to use the vast knowledge and helpfulness of the Internet to really make something beautiful. Practically everything useful that I know I learned or sometimes stealed from Stack Overflow. And this is the result.

This is in many ways a very simple site and it will not have you browsing for hours. For me, this was a way of dipping my feet into web design and at the same time create a simple web-page. You will find links to where I'm available on the web and some of my dslr photos. I have taken most of the photos myself, but Mikaela are also responsible for some of them (probably the best ones). I also have a page with my resume for those who would be interested in that. I'm very grateful for your visit and hope to hear from you soon.

Oh and by the way, you can find the entire source code for this webpage on my github page. You can read and copy the code as you like or maybe just download some of the photos for your own pleasure.Oh and please don't hate me for having a personal site without a good reason, I know that this whole project is a bit narcissistic.

Please Enjoy!
