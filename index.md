Welcome to my personal homepage. If you don't already know (I guess you do) my name is Kim Torberntsson. I live in Uppsala with my lovely fianc√©e Mikaela Blom and am currently studying Engineering Physics at Uppsala University. During the autumn of 2014 I took a course in web design and learned just enough to build a simple web-page. About a year later the 2.0 version of the site way finished, now built using Jekyll and featuring a new page with my personal blog.

For me, this is mostly a way of dipping my feet into web design. Scrolling down you'll find links to where I'm available on the web. Photographer [Scott Kelby](http://scottkelby.com) once said that you should have your 24 best photos on your personal site, so I added a page with them, though I'm not sure if they really are my best. Also, Mikaela are responsible for some of them so I can't really take credit for them all. There is also a page with my resume. It's really fun you came by.

Best Regards

//Kim Torberntsson
